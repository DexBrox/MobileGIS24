# MobileGIS24 

## Software to use:
  - git for version control and collaborating
  - webstorm for developing with framework react native -> best access to sensors and device functions (like ring tones and vibrations)

## Goal: Tourist map with navigation
  - we need: knowledge on tourist spots
  - access to navigation sensors and maybe other (e.g. pose refinement via CV by google)
  - maybe other device functions

## Minimal features
  - Use of location Sensor (GNSS)
  - Visualization of map tiles (WMS)
  - Visualization of features (WFS)
  - Appropriate Control
  - Optional: Creation of new features (WFS-T)

## Steps to get current repo up and running with React Native Expo:
  - install expo App on your phone
  - npm i -g expo-cli
  - expo install expo-location
  - run "npm start" in this repo
  - scan qr code

## Current features
  - two views, one holds a text view, one holds a built-in map
  - shows current position on the map

## What to do next:
